# Work Day Scheduler

A simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. The Day.js library is used to work with date and time.

## User Story
- AS AN employee with a busy schedule
- I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
- SO THAT I can manage my time effectively


## Acceptance Criteria
- GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
- WHEN I open the planner
- THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
- WHEN I scroll down
- THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
- WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
- THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
- WHEN I click into a time block
- THEN I can enter an event
- WHEN I click the save button for that time block
- THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
- WHEN I refresh the page
- THEN the saved events persist


## Approach
To approach this project, I utilized the starter code and Day.js library to create a dynamic work day scheduler. I used jQuery to manipulate the DOM and dynamically update the HTML and CSS based on user interactions. I also utilized local storage to save and retrieve events that the user has added to the scheduler.


## Completed tasks
- Set up HTML and CSS structure for the scheduler
- Created time blocks for standard business hours
- Used Day.js to display the current day at the top of the calendar
- Color-coded time blocks to indicate whether they are in the past, present, or future
- Enabled user input for events
- Utilized local storage to save and retrieve events

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this project successfully created a work day scheduler that allows users to manage their time effectively. The project utilized the Day.js library and jQuery to dynamically update the HTML and CSS based on user interactions, and local storage to save and retrieve events. The scheduler meets all of the acceptance criteria and can be used as a simple but effective tool for time management.
